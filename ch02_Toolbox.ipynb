    "To illustrate how we can use Pandas in a simple real problem, we will start doing some basic analysis of government data. For the sake of transparency, data produced by government entities must be open, meaning that they can be freely used, reused and distributed by anyone. An example of this is the Eurostat, which is the home of European Commission data. Eurostat’s main role is to process and publish comparable statistical information at the European level. The data in Eurostat are provided by each member state and it is free to reuse them, both for noncommercial and commercial purposes (with some minor exceptions).  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the amount of data in the Eurostat database is huge, in our first study we are only going to focus on data relative to indicators of educational funding by the member states. Thus, the first thing to do is to retrieve such data from Eurostat. Since open data have to be delivered in a plain text format, CSV (or any other delimiter-separated value) formats are commonly used to store tabular data. In a delimiter-separated value file, each line is a data record and each record consists of one or more fields, separated by the delimiter character (usually a comma). Therefore, the data we will use can be found already downloaded and preprocessed as a CSV file *educ_figdp_1_Data.csv* which can be download from the book's Github webpage. Of course, it can also be downloaded as unprocessed tabular data from the Eurostat database site [Eurostat database site]( http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database) \n",

Besides the name of the file, we add the *na_values* key argument to this method along with the character that represents \"non available data\" in the file. Normally, CSV files have a header with the names of the columns. If this is the case,  we can use the *usecols* parameter to select which columns in the file will be used.\n",

But first, we need to clean up our previous pivoted table a bit so that it only has real countries with real data. To do this, first we drop the Euro area entries and shorten the Germany name entry, using the **rename** function and then we drop all the rows containing any NaN, using the **dropna** function.\n",

In our case, we use the  **first** method, in which ranks are assigned in the order they appear in the array, avoiding gaps between ranking."

    "It is also possible to plot a DataFrame directly. In this case, each column is treated as a separated Series. For example, instead of printing the accumulated value over the years, we can plot the value for each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we have used a horizontal bar diagram (`kind='barh'`) stacking all the years in the same country bar. This can be done by setting the parameter **stacked** to `True`. The number of default colors in a plot is only 5, thus if you have more than 5 Series to show, you need to specify more colors or otherwise the same set of colors will be used again. We can set a new set of colors using the keyword **color** with a list of colors. Basic colors have a single-character code assigned to each, for example, 'b' is for blue, 'r' for red, 'g' for green, 'y' for yellow, 'm' for magenta and 'c' for cyan. When several Series are shown in a plot, a legend is created for identifying each one. The name for each Series is the name of the column in the DataFrame. By default, the legend goes inside the plot area. If we want to change this, we can use the **legend** function of the axis object (this is the object returned when the plot function is called). By using the **loc** keyword, we can set the relative position of the legend with respect to the plot. It can be a combination of right or left and upper, lower or center. With**bbox_to_anchor** we can set an absolute position with respect to the plot, allowing us to put the legend outside the graph."
